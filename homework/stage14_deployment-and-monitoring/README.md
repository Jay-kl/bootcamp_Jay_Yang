## 📊 Monitoring Architecture

### Four-Layer Monitoring Strategy

1. **Data Layer Monitoring**
   - Data freshness tracking (< 30 seconds)
   - Feature null rate monitoring (< 5%)
   - Schema validation and drift detection
   - Upstream data source health checks

2. **Model Layer Monitoring**
   - Real-time accuracy tracking (> 75%)
   - Prediction confidence scoring
   - Model calibration validation
   - Distribution shift detection

3. **System Layer Monitoring**
   - API latency (P95 < 10ms)
   - Error rates (< 0.1%)
   - Throughput and scalability metrics
   - Resource utilization tracking

4. **Business Layer Monitoring**
   - Trading P&L correlation with predictions
   - False positive/negative rates
   - API adoption and usage metrics
   - Revenue attribution analysis

## 🚨 Alert Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
